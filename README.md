# vueblogservices
Back end for vueblog app made in PHP/Laravel

This repository is the backend for the [vueblog](https://github.com/gersonmontenegro/vueblog) application, and I'm going to try to explain as much I can because there are only a few hours left to complete this challenge.

An idea about what I'm going to do, is listed below:

 1. Install Laravel 5.7
 2. Create the repository
 3. Install passport package
 4. Create database
 5. Install MongoDB, and set it on Laravel.
 6. Make some services
 7. Create Unit tests
 8. Integrate with Frontend

The is a lot of work to do, and my MondoDB "Kung FÃº" is oxidized :)
